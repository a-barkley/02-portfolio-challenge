                <p>Hello! My name is Pat Barkley, and I am a 23 year old (future) web developer. I am currently working as a substitute teacher, but hope to enter the world of tech soon after completing my certification from Berkeley. Originally from the state of Alabama, I moved to Chicago after graduating from the University of Alabama in 2021 with a degree in Journalism and Creative Media. While at the University of Alabama I maintained a GPA of 3.8, and picked up a minor in French.</p>
